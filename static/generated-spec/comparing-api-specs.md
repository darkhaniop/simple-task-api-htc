# Comparing API Specs (Flask+apispec vs. FastAPI)

> [!NOTE]
> The app does not use `static/generated-spec/openapi.json`, therefore, keeping this
> file up-to-date is not required.

To help with future debugging of the Simple Task API (STAPI) app, we put both versions
of the STAPI OpenAPI 3.x specifications into the code repository.

The two spec files in this dir were generated using different frameworks.
* `spec.json` was generated by an original Flask+marshmallow+apispec app.
* `opanapi.json` was generated by the refactored FastAPI (PydanticV2) app.

When running the app, e.g. in `/instance`, a subdir `/instance/generated-spec` must be
created in advance. The latest `openapi.json` spec file will be created or replaced in
this subdir.
